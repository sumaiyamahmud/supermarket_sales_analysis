Here's an interpretation of the graph above:

Comparisons:

•	Median (Central Tendency):

•	The median represents the central tendency of the data. Products in the "Food and Beverages" category have the highest median (7.5), suggesting higher overall customer satisfaction. "Electronics" has the lowest median (6.7).

•	Box Length (Spread):

•	The length of the box (Interquartile Range) indicates the spread of the middle 50% of the data. "Food ad Beverages" and "Health and Beauty" have relatively wider spreads, while "Electronics" has a narrower spread.

•	Whisker Range (Variability):

•	The whiskers show the variability of the data outside the box. The whisker ranges are similar across categories.

Correlation Assessment:

•	Based on the provided information, it's challenging to determine a clear correlation between customer satisfaction and product category. The box plots provide insights into the distribution, central tendency, and variability, but additional statistical analysis may be needed for a more precise correlation assessment.

### Cost Analysis
